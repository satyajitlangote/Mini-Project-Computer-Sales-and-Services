                In the current computer world FASTER is better.<br>
<br>
The speed of a computer, how fast it will run your programs, is determined by the processor and RAM. All<br> you need to remember is that the higher the number, the faster the machine. Buy a computer with the fastest<br> microprocessor you can afford because at the end of four years it will be the slowest still available on the<br> market. No matter how much you upgrade newer and better models will continually appear.<br>
<br>
Most of us object to paying for something, only to find it worth much less a short distance down the road.<br> Unfortunately, you might as well get used to it. You also might as well jump in when you need a system and<br> look at the price as an investment instead of an expense.<br>
<br>
Buy your computer-based on what you're going to do with it. If you've never used a computer before, you may<br> take help from Unique computers technician for a consultant to know the suitable configuration for you. <br>so you'll have to use your perceived needs and your budget as your rule of thumb. In that case, a good rule of<br> thumb is to buy as much computer as you can afford and earmark ten to fifteen percent extra because you always<br> end up spending more than you plan.<br>
<br>
Another rule of thumb is to get the fastest PC you can afford. Computer speeds are measured in cores of the<br> microprocessor and the higher the number the faster the microprocessor runs - at least in theory. There's a<br> lot more to a computer's speed than just the microprocessor clock speed (like the amount of RAM, cache, etc.)<br> but it's a good starting point.<br>
<br>
Spend as much as you can comfortably afford. The more you invest, the longer your system will remain<br> viable.<br>
<br>
Technology continues to evolve at a rapid rate. Newer technology is always right around the corner, but this<br> should not deter you from buying the system you need now.<br>
<br>
Unless you have specific needs, you don't need to acquire the absolutely highest level of current technology.<br> On the other hand, saving a few amount by buying low on the technology curve is a false economy.<br>
<br>
When you buy a desktop, one of your main goals is that you want it to be upgradeable. That means the following<br> can easily be removed and replaced<br>
<br>
Hard Drive, CD/DVD Drives, Memory (RAM), CPU, Video Card and Sound Card<br>
<br>
If any of the above cannot be upgraded, you are buying into a closed system â€“ like a laptop. All laptops are<br> closed systems because their video, sound, and CPU generally cannot be upgraded.<br>
